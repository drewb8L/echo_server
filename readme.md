# Http Server
Http server is a Kotlin application that can be used to serve files over the web

## Installation


Clone the repo
```git
git clone https://github.com/drewb8L/echo_server.git
```
Optionally, you can see the latest features with:
```git
git checkout http_server
```

## Usage

### Note:
This read me will be updated once gradle errors are resolved. As of now, using Intelij is the recomended was to build and run the server.
# ____________________________________________

Open repo in IntelliJ Idea and allow the IDE to install sdk and dependencies.
Run the main function to start the server.

Once the server is running open your client and connect to 127.0.0.1 port 8080.

when a connection is established, you will see this message,

```"Enter some text to send to the server, close connection by entering '.':"```

The server will echo your input after you type in some text and hit enter.

To close the connection type a period '.' with no other text or space and hit enter. The connection will close.
